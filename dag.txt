1. Start by installing dbt, airflow, and great expectations in your python environment.
2. Create a new dbt project and define the data models you want to build. Use dbt to write SQL code to transform and clean the data.
3. Set up an airflow DAG to automate the data pipeline. Use airflow to schedule and run the dbt commands to build the data models.
4. Use great expectations to create expectations for the data models. These expectations will be used to validate the data and ensure it meets the desired quality standards.
5. Integrate great expectations into the airflow DAG by using the great expectations airflow operator. This operator will run the great expectations checks and raise an error if any expectations are not met.
6. Set up an alert system to notify you if any errors occur in the pipeline. This can be done using airflow's alerting feature or by integrating with a third-party service such as Slack.
7. Continuously monitor and test the pipeline to ensure it is running smoothly and making accurate predictions. Use the great expectations data docs feature to document and share the pipeline with other stakeholders.
8. Finally, use dbt's version control feature to keep track of changes made to the pipeline over time and make it easy to roll back to a previous version if necessary.
